# StockAnalysis

A Python-based tool that captures stock charts, fetches technical indicators, and analyzes market trends using OpenAI's GPT model. This tool leverages TradingView for charting and analysis, allowing users to input stock symbols and timeframes for comprehensive stock analysis.

## Features

- Capture screenshots of TradingView charts for multiple stock symbols.
- Fetch technical indicator readings using the `tradingview-ta` library.
- Send images and indicator data to OpenAI's GPT for analysis.
- Save screenshots, indicators, and API responses in specified directories.

   Replace `"your api"` in the script with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. **Modify Chrome executable path:**

   Ensure the path to the Chrome executable is correctly set in the script (`chrome_executable_path`).

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Input the stock symbols:**

   When prompted, enter the stock symbols you wish to analyze, separated by commas (e.g., `AAPL,TSLA`).

3. **Select timeframes:**
